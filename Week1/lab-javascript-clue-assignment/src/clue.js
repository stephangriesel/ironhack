/* Iteration 1 - Creating the cards
Clue has three different types of cards: suspects, rooms, and weapons. These three types of cards are always separated. Use data structures to model and create these cards.

In order to do this, you will need to know the game's characters (possible killers), available weapons and house rooms.

Game Characters
This Clue board game has a new roster of playable characters. All of them have first names, last names, occupations, age, description, and images. On the clue.js file you will find all the info about them.

Available Weapons
There are nine weapons. Each of them has different weight, same as the characters, you will find all the info needed on the clue.js file.

House Rooms
The game board represents the blueprints of a mansion and features fifteen different rooms. Yes, you guess, on the clue.js file you have all the info.

Data Structuring
Create one data structure for each of the people, weapons, and rooms described above. Each document must have all the info.

After creating the data structure, create an array for each type of data and push every document into their corresponding array.

Iteration 2 - Creating the mistery
At the beginning of the game, players shuffle each one of the card stacks to create a combination of suspect, weapon and room. This will be the mystery to solve.

Remember our tests!
We will be working with test again! You need to open the SpecRunner.html file in order to see them. The following instructions will guide you through all the methods and functionality your code should have to pass all the tests.

// 1. Random Selector
Create a method randomSelector to randomly select one element from a card stack. The method should receive an array as an argument, and return randomly one of the elements of the array.

/* 

// 2. Create the mystery
We need to create a pickMistery method that will call randomSelector for each card stack, and return an array with the 3 picked cards, a character, a weapon and a room. Our mystery should be stored on a misteryEnvelope variable.

*/

Iteration 3 - Revealing the mistery
Finally, we need to reveal the mystery. Create a revealMistery method, that will receive our misteryEnvelope array as an argument and return the revealed mystery like this:
