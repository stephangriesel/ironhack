Iteration 1: Creating one product
We will start by creating the HTML for one of your products. It should look like this:

Every product will have:

A wrapper div that contains all the HTML for that product.
A div with a span, showing the product name.
A div with a span, showing the cost of one unit.
A div with one label and one input, where the user will indicate how many units they will buy.
A div with a span, showing the total price for this product. This number should be the result of multiplying the amount of units multiplied by the price of one unit of that product. The default total price should be 0.
A div with a delete button, to remove the product from the list.
Calculating the total price for the product
Once you have the HTML and CSS ready, use JavaScript and functions of the document object to retrieve the data you need to calculate the total price for that product. Change the value of the element in the DOM that displays the total price:

Create a click event for the Calculate Prices button
This event will execute a function that:
Retrieves the unit price of the product
Retrieves the quantity of items desired
Calculates the total price based on this data
Updates the total price in the DOM
